# My OpenCV Study Notes

🖥️ 👀

## Resources I've Used

1. [OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)

## Source of Images

Images displayed in the notebooks are from various sources, including the ones listed 
[above](#resources-ive-used). I'm also a great art fan ( and actually quite an artist myself ),
so I also used images from various artists that I really like. If you'd like to support them,
here is where you can find them ❤️:
